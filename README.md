# Book Recommendation System
This repository is about a book recommendation system and has transferred to a web service that was written by Python. 
this project contains two parts. The first is the model and implementation for predicting books. The second is a web service for getting the output of the module as API. (codes about creating model not included)     

## About the model
Overall, the approach of creating a model is collaborating filtering and the output files of the model are `PivotTable.csv` and `Re-Array.npy`.
After installing the requirements and running the application normally, the following documentation is available.
---

# Install
